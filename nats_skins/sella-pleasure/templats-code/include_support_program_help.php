There are a few words below about us and a proposal to you, but you know we are very flexible and work with many companies on individual terms.
            <br><br>
            If you’d like to know more about us, we were created out of two founding companies in 1993, eline Productions and GameLink, to become ‘Innov8,’ which through organic evolution is now set to evolve as the one of the leading companies in this industry! We have created a one-stop platform which either includes or is set to include all the major players in our business.
            <br><br>
            The shift in our industry during Covid has led to sales volumes increasing not through retail outlets, but online sales, driven mainly by influencers. It means we have had to adjust by learning to use sophisticated marketing tools, either working from home or another convenient place of your choice. We fully support these operations promoting businesses as more individuals and companies are switching more of their attention to online business activities.
            <br><br>
            The key idea here is influencer marketing, involving individuals who have huge on-line followings. They recommend products and services to those guys who check into their personal on-line space every day to see what they are up to. We have collected together all the relevant influencers, good quality industry related products and brands, creating one platform, an online market place called SellaPleasure. Potential customers do not have to go hunting round the internet to find similar products and then lose interest, as everything is here!
            <br><br>
            Adult products are very specific and many people are not ready to get involved in this business. Our influencers have checked and trained their followers, who are interested in building an adult business, so they are comfortable talking about the products and services. Going to an individual influencer, untried, untested and who may not have a high engagement rate, can quickly lead to disappointment. All they might be interested in is a few freebies. They may not be comfortable talking with their subs about the topic and that could lead to a total breakdown.
            <br><br>
            This is why, we have collected together around 1000 high-engagement influencers and they consist of those guys, who we believe will optimize our success. They come from our industry specific backgrounds, including sexual wellness and sex ed.: such as adult performers, webcam and adult content creators, therapists, sex coaches, relationship coaches and advisors, podcasters, Trans and LGBTQ+ activists, sexologists, sex positive bloggers and like-minded people.
            <br><br>
            A couple of things to note, firstly we are engaging with a growing number of influencers as time passes, by helping them match the target audience with your products Also, this is the first platform where all brands and all influencers can meet without having to register separately on multiple platforms.
