            <h5 id='what-is-a-deep-link'>What is a deep link?</h5>
            <p>In the context of influencer marketing, a deep link is a hyperlink that points to a specific product or page within an app or website, rather than just the homepage. Deep links are often used in influencer marketing to drive traffic to a particular product or service that the influencer is promoting, rather than just the brand&#39;s website or app.</p>
            <p> For example, a beauty influencer promoting a specific lipstick shade may include a deep link in their social media post that directs followers to the product page for that particular shade. This makes it easier for followers to find and purchase the product, and also provides more accurate tracking of the influencer&#39;s impact on sales.</p>
            <p> Deep links can be created using various tools and platforms, such as affiliate marketing platforms, and can be tracked to measure the effectiveness of the influencer&#39;s promotion.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h5 id='what-content-is-trading-right-now-'>What Content is trending right now ? </h5>
            <p>The type of content that is trending for influencer marketing can vary depending on the industry, target audience, and social media platform. However, there are some general trends that have emerged in recent years:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Video content: Video content, especially short-form videos like TikTok and Reels, has become increasingly popular for influencer marketing. This type of content is engaging, shareable, and can quickly go viral.</li>

            </ol>
            <p> </p>
            <ol start='2'>
                <li>Authenticity: Consumers are looking for authentic content from influencers, rather than overly produced or scripted content. Influencers who share their genuine experiences and opinions tend to be more successful in building trust with their followers.</li>

            </ol>
            <p> </p>
            <ol start='3'>
                <li>Niche content: Niche content that is specific to a particular interest or hobby has become more popular in recent years. Influencers who have a dedicated following in a particular niche can be very effective in promoting products related to that niche.</li>

            </ol>
            <p> </p>
            <ol start='4'>
                <li>Educational content: Influencers who can provide educational content, such as tutorials or how-to videos, are also becoming more popular. This can be particularly effective in industries like beauty, fashion, and fitness.</li>

            </ol>
            <p> </p>
            <ol start='5'>
                <li>Social causes: Consumers are increasingly interested in influencers who are passionate about social causes and use their platform to raise awareness and advocate for change. Influencers who are authentic and passionate about a particular cause can be very effective in promoting brands that align with those values.</li>

            </ol>
            <p> Overall, the key to successful influencer marketing is to create content that is engaging, authentic, and relevant to the target audience.</p>

                <h4><span style='color: #ffffff;'>Looking for Green Lights when signing up
                        for a B2B affiliate program</span></h4>
            </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>


            <p>B2B affiliate marketing differs from B2C. Let’s take a look, so you can get the most out of your affiliate
                partnerships.</p>
            <p><strong>First Green Light: A professional looking website and product</strong></p>
            <p>Partner programs should be backed up by a professional website that clearly communicates the product or service and
                how it would be useful to the potential buyer. Let’s take an online educational tool: does it offer access to both
                children and parents? Can you upload materials easily? Users need to feel comfortable and connected to the product,
                in both the B2B and B2C segments, as emotional product connection is key. In order to drive conversions remember to
                be specific about product benefits, allow your audience to interact and retain interest by tailoring messages. </p>
            <p><strong>Second Green Light: Your niche area aligned with the partner program</strong> </p>
            <p>Before marketing in the partner program, check the following questions, </p>
            <p>What reviews does the product have from customers, with a similar back ground to your audience? Positive reviews from
                G2, LinkedIn or web-based review sites can help you decide whether or not to proceed to the partner program site.
            </p>
            <p>What needs does the product meet? Converting links will depend on the ‘search intent’ that leads your audience to
                your content. Go to ‘search intent,&#39; then ‘transactional,’ on a company’s website on your search engine
                optimization tool, so Ahrefs or Semrush. This indicates searchers who are are looking to make a purchase.</p>
            <p><strong>Third Green Light: There is a detailed public partner page</strong> </p>
            <p>As an affiliate marketer, commissions that you earn on conversions represent time spent planning, creating, and
                editing content. Partner programs that detail what you can get out of the plan, show a commitment from the vendor
                that they want you to succeed. A benefits description, including commission and perks you can earn from a public
                affiliate marketing scheme might catch your eye. They may also describe ideal affiliate partners and success stories
                from the program experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Fourth Green Light: A good program incentivizes you to sell more</strong></p>
            <p>While high commissions are attractive, structured programs with tiered pricing designed to incentivize you are best.
                For example, programs that reward you proportionately to the profit the company will make on the conversion, which
                you helped drive.

            <p>Ask yourself, is the commission structure competitive? Think about how much work you need to put in to promote the
                product, the cost of the product compared to your commission and the norms in the industry.</p>
            <p>Finally check other partner programs in the industry promoting similar products to the ones you are promoting. Use
                the Google “vs.” search tactic. Enter the name of the company that runs the partner program you’d like to join, and
                then the term “vs.” You’ll see competitors come up in Google suggested search terms. The partner program’s
                incentives should be similar and in line with industry standards.</p>

                <h4><span style='color: #ffffff;'>Five myths about affiliate marketing - busted</span></h4>
            </a>
        </dt>
        <dd>

            <p><strong>Myth #1: Affiliate marketing is just for B2C</strong></p>
            <p>Some of you first encounter affiliate marketing, influencers on Instagram insist their followers buy vitamin
                supplements using the link in their bio or they see promo codes shared on couponing websites like Honey or
                RetailMeNot. </p>
            <p>Less common is B2B affiliate marketing. It looks different from consumer affiliate marketing, anything from a link in
                a member association’s newsletter to a tech. review website link.</p>
            <p>In reality the most successful B2B software brands rely on affiliate programs to sustainably grow their revenue.
                Unbounce, a no-code landing page builder, drives 25% of ‘new trial starts’ from affiliates. Half of those trials
                convert into paid users. </p>
            <p><strong>Myth #2: Content creators are the only kinds of affiliates</strong></p>
            <p>People associate affiliates with content creators, blog publishers and social media product posts. However, B2B
                affiliates can be a company or an individual you share an audience with. Other SaaS applications you share a
                customer base with make ideal affiliate partners. Suppose a CRM integrates with a video marketing platform, it could
                be a great affiliate for the video platform. The CRM sends an email link to their customer base, while providing new
                business to the video marketing platform.</p>
            <p>Some of the most can be banks. There are six banks in Canada that collectively have wide-reaching marketing partners
                and access to every single consumer in small business in the country. If they advise customers to buy an insurance
                product, the take up can be huge, even though most people wouldn’t think of banks as affiliates. </p>
            <p>Affiliates can also be publishers and content syndicators, like CNET or G2. Folks in B2B should think about
                affiliates as anyone who has access to your prospective customer base and could promote your products to them using
                affiliate links. In many ways, it&#39;s just like partner marketing or co-marketing. </p>
            <p><strong>Myth #3: Affiliate marketing is inherently risky</strong></p>
            <p>Consumer affiliate marketing can leave marketers vulnerable to fraud, the risk is less in B2B. In B2C, there&#39;s a
                long history of fraudulent activity from bots or click farms.</p>
            <p>In B2B, revenue is key, especially as marketing teams become increasingly responsible for driving metrics further
                down the funnel. Since you typically only pay affiliates once they close revenue for your business, it’s nearly
                impossible to game the system. This means you can try many affiliates without worrying too much about the results
                they’ll drive.</p>
            <p><strong>Myth #4: You need vertical alignment with your affiliates</strong></p>
            <p>“Something that a lot of people get wrong is they think they need to work with an affiliate partner that is in their
                vertical, but that&#39;s actually not the case,” says Luke Swanek, one of PartnerStack’s co-founders. </p>
            <p>“For example, QuickBooks affiliates don&#39;t need to talk about bookkeeping on their blogs. They just need to reach
                the end customer that QuickBooks is pursuing, which is small business owners,” Luke explains. “Ideal affiliates for
                QuickBooks would include the National Association of Realtors, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, or
                Canadian Small Business Association.”</p>
            <p>What matters in a B2B affiliate is customer alignment. If an association, a membership-based organization, or
                publication has an audience with your ideal customers, then they’re a perfect fit. Curious which ones are a fit for
                your customers? Start asking them where they get their news and what conferences they attend. </p>
            <p>Even if these organizations have nothing to do with the product you are trying to sell, they make excellent
                co-marketing and affiliate partners to work with since they have access to your audience. Reach out to these
                organizations, ask to be an affiliate and emphasize the partnerships value to their audience.</p>
            <p><strong>Myth #5: The same playbook will work for B2B and B2C affiliates</strong></p>
            <p>The goal of consumer affiliate is often a one-time, transactional purchase. But the goal in B2B is to have customers
                continually purchase a subscription. Naturally, the same tactics won’t work for each.</p>
            <p>“Software isn&#39;t sold like a pair of jeans,” says Nikita Zhitkevich, Director of Channel Partnerships and
                Alliances at PartnerStack. “There is a lot more variability in the B2B selling process than there is in B2C.
                Partners in B2B need to be strategic, unlike in B2C where you don’t necessarily need any deep or specific expertise
                to make a product look cool.”</p>
            <p>What’s more, there&#39;s limited loyalty between consumer affiliates and brands they represent. “A B2C affiliate
                could sell a Nalgene water bottle and Bose headphones. They&#39;re two completely different things. Then I could
                sell a YETI bottle instead of a Nalgene, and it doesn’t change anything,” says Luke.</p>
            <p>But in B2B, you’re building long-term relationships with affiliates your customers can trust and who have their
                finger on the pulse in the software ecosystem. “B2B affiliates need to represent a connected stack of solutions
                working harmoniously together to provide value to a business owner. In consumer, it&#39;s almost impossible to do.
                Are your headphones and your water bottle complementary? Sure. But do they integrate? Of course not,” says Luke.</p>

                    If you’d like to know more about us, we were created out of two founding companies in 1993, eline Productions and GameLink, to become ‘Innov8,’ which through organic evolution is now set to evolve as the one of the leading companies in this industry! We have created a one-stop platform which either includes or is set to include all the major players in our business.
                    <br><br>
                    The shift in our industry during Covid has led to sales volumes increasing not through retail outlets, but online sales, driven mainly by influencers. It means we have had to adjust by learning to use sophisticated marketing tools, either working from home or another convenient place of your choice. We fully support these operations promoting businesses as more individuals and companies are switching more of their attention to online business activities.
                    <br><br>
                    The key idea here is influencer marketing, involving individuals who have huge on-line followings. They recommend products and services to those guys who check into their personal on-line space every day to see what they are up to. We have collected together all the relevant influencers, good quality industry related products and brands, creating one platform, an online market place called SellaPleasure. Potential customers do not have to go hunting round the internet to find similar products and then lose interest, as everything is here!
                    <br><br>
                    Adult products are very specific and many people are not ready to get involved in this business. Our influencers have checked and trained their followers, who are interested in building an adult business, so they are comfortable talking about the products and services. Going to an individual influencer, untried, untested and who may not have a high engagement rate, can quickly lead to disappointment. All they might be interested in is a few freebies. They may not be comfortable talking with their subs about the topic and that could lead to a total breakdown.
                    <br><br>
                    This is why, we have collected together around 1000 high-engagement influencers and they consist of those guys, who we believe will optimize our success. They come from our industry specific backgrounds, including sexual wellness and sex ed.: such as adult performers, webcam and adult content creators, therapists, sex coaches, relationship coaches and advisors, podcasters, Trans and LGBTQ+ activists, sexologists, sex positive bloggers and like-minded people.
                    <br><br>
                    A couple of things to note, firstly we are engaging with a growing number of influencers as time passes, by helping them match the target audience with your products Also, this is the first platform where all brands and all influencers can meet without having to register separately on multiple platforms.

                    <h4 id='what-is-sellapleasure'>What is SellAPleasure?</h4>
                    <p>In today’s digital world, social content creators with niche audiences can often offer added value to brands. More
                        than two-thirds (<a href='https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencer-monetization-2021'>67.9%</a>) of U.S
                        marketers will use some form of influencer marketing this year. That’s expected to increase to 72.5% in 2022. </p>
                    <p>In order to make it as easy as possible for a selected number of influencers to generate revenue, we have come up
                        with an amazing digital solution- SellAPleasure, platform, that connects multiple brands of adult business with
                        influencers. We fully embrace <em>influencer marketing</em> as it has become the go-to choice for promoting adult
                        products. </p>

                        presence in the influencer marketing area. </p>
                    <p><em>Values.</em> We have observed that people have so little access to good quality sex education. Influencers can
                        help to deliver sex positive messages to the public, creating a friendly, loyal attitude and attracting new
                        customers. Our platform can help you grow sales or earnings with minimal costs and increase sex positivity attitudes

                    <p>This is an important soft skill, to communicate effectively with existing customers and the potential client base.
                        This all helps to make generating revenue streams on adult products much easier for everyone. Merchants and
                        influencers are bound to work together more closely and must establish a strong rapport to be mutually successful.

            <p align='center'><img src="/img-smp/monetize.gif" width="100%" height="auto" style='border: 0; outline: none; max-width: 450px;'></p>



            There are an increasing number of opportunities to monetize your content. Affiliate marketing
            budgets are expected to reach $8.2 billion in 2022, up from $2.8 billion in just five years. But
            when it comes to making money, not all affiliate content is created equal. To maximize revenue,
            you need to balance seasonal and limited-time period offers with evergreen commerce content
            that converts all year round. Want to get some of the most effective affiliate marketing content
            ideas and see examples of how successful affiliate websites drive conversions? Then read on.
            Below is a list of popular types of affiliate marketing content.<br><br>
            1. Reviews.<br><br>
            Write when and how you found out about a particular product, why you decided to try it,
            and how it helped you. and mention what you think could be improved. Why share bugs
            and problems when you want to sell your product? You will find that it helps you identify
            objectively and make the right decisions. For example, if you are a sex toy manufacturer,
            you should not only highlight the best toys and their features, but also who should
            purchase which toys. Explaining features can help demonstrate why it is cheaper or a bit
            more expensive (assuming it is).The main goal here is to give readers enough information
            about a product worth buying without over-promoting it.<br><br>

            2. Product Comparison<br><br>
            Comparing goods is very useful for Internet users who are planning to buy a particular product
            and want to know how it stacks up against alternative products. The comparative guide clearly
            shows the main similarities and differences between products, their respective strengths and
            weaknesses, and which one is better value for money. All this information is invaluable for those
            who want to choose the best product from many options. Providing this kind of information will
            give you confidence in your own expertise and help your readers become your affiliates. You can
            encourage them to buy using the link.<br><br>
            2. Product Briefs<br><br>
            Product briefs are effective because they direct different readers to an assortment of
            products. In other words, an affiliate&#39;s earnings do not necessarily depend on links. With
            this is mind, clearly highlighting the products you recommend will help readers make
            decisions, which will lead to more conversions. For example, in this subscription box
            summarized by Byrdie, the first box listed is the best overall. also includes the perfect
            box for your specific needs, but The Curateur is the clear winner, likely to convert more
            readers than the other recommendations. A significant difference between product
            overviews and product comparisons is that products may be so different that they cannot
            be evaluated in the same &quot;category&quot;. Where direct comparison is difficult, it makes sense
            to create a round up instead. The key to this affiliate marketing strategy is to summarize
            based on specific topics or categories that are relevant to your target audience. Whether
            you&#39;re a beauty fan or a hardcore gamer. Look at buyer intent keywords to determine
            what products people may be searching for, and use those keywords in your headlines.<br><br>


            1. Email Marketing<br><br>
            Building an active and engaged email list is a step most publishers overlook. However, this is the
            single most effective channel for generating repeat sales as an affiliate. Using email affiliate
            marketing as a method of driving traffic to affiliate content includes creating emails as stand
            alone pieces designed to convert directly or linking to existing content (blogs, tutorials, etc.).
            However, whether or not you need to link directly in your email depends on your network or
            advertiser rules. For example, Amazon does not allow affiliate links in emails. In such cases, we
            recommend including a link to your blog or landing page in your newsletter. Either way, you can
            get creative by monetizing your newsletter with affiliate content: Add affiliate links related to
            your welcome series Include a &#39;For You&#39; section in your regular emails So create an email course.
            Round up existing product reviews. Highlight products you find particularly useful. Regardless
            of how you present your content, make sure your emails continue to provide value. Users are
            more likely to unsubscribe from emails or mark emails as spam if the content does not feel
            genuine or is overly promotional.<br><br>

            1. Tutorials<br><br>
            One of the reasons people don&#39;t buy items is because they don&#39;t know how to use them. Some
            people are unsure whether to buy a product or service. In addition, some people do not buy
            goods that they don’t know how to operate in the first place. As a result, if you create tutorials to
            teach people how to use your product or service, customers are more likely to purchase affiliate
            products, even if they are not yet familiar with them. So you should describe all of its major
            features. This generates understanding and more people are sure to buy it.
            <br><br>
            1. Video<br><br>
            Video is growing in popularity. Did you know they account for around 82% of all consumer
            internet traffic? While YouTube is the most popular channel for watching videos,TikTok is
            another channel where content creators want to publish their creative work. It is also a platform.
            Video content is much more difficult to organize than website content. Still, it helps you reach
            audiences searching with buyer intent. Videos are the best way to promote your affiliate products
            and put together product tutorials and product comparitive videos. Content creators or publishers
            can post affiliate links in their descriptions to earn affiliate commissions.<br><br>
            1. Social Media Posts<br><br>
            Social media is the best way to connect with people. Today, 4.62 billion people use social
            media. It is therefore a great way for content creators and publishers to engage and communicate
            with their users. The average time people spend on social media each day is about 2 hours and 27
            minutes. To use social media effectively, you should: Consistently post social media content.
            Post different types of content that people enjoy posting. Don&#39;t participate in all social media
            channels, only those which are popular platforms used by your target audience<br><br>

            promoting, thereby encouraging a potential purchase. Stories like this are useful because they
            help people relate to your product. Encouraging them to empathize with the problem you&#39;re

            knowledge in a particular area by answering questions from your audience and incorporating
            your product into your answers. You can also promote your affiliate products by offering your
            webinar attendees unique discount codes and limited-time offers. Additionally, preparing and

            used seasonal events and special occasions to promote products and drive sales. Think about
            what seasonal trends or special occasions you can use to promote your product and create
            content around that topic. For example, create a list of your must-have skincare products for the
            cold winter or a necessary mobile app for summer travel, and share that list with relevant
            communities.<br><br>
