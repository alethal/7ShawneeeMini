    Enrollment in the Affiliate Program
</div>

<div class="terms_text">
    Firstly, you must submit an Affiliate Program Application on www.sellapleasure.com. You
    must accurately complete the application and meet our basic requirements to be
    considered as an affiliate. Having reviewed your application, we will notify you of your
    acceptance or rejection to the Affiliate Program, generally within two (2) to five (5)
    business days. We may accept or reject your application at our sole discretion for any reason.
</div>

<div class="terms_header">
    Obligations of the Parties
</div>

<div class="terms_text">
    SELLAPLEASURE agrees to the following, provided that we continue to accept you as an
    associate and that you abide by the terms and conditions of this Agreement:
    <br><br>
    1. We will provide you with graphic and text links to the Program Web Sites and/or other
    creative materials via the Affiliate Program (collectively, the "Links") so that you can
    display them on websites you own or control, in emails you send that are clearly marked
    as coming from you, and in online advertisements (collectively, "Media"). The Links will
    establish a link from your Media to the Program Web Site and help to identify you as a
    participant in our Affiliate Program.
    <br><br>
    2. For each action deemed by SELLAPLEASURE as a "Qualifying Action," we shall pay the
    Affiliate (the "Commission"). An individual who (i) accesses the Program Web Site through
    the Link, which is the last link to the Program Web Site, (ii) is not a computer generated
    user, such as a robot, spider, computer script, or other automated, artificial, or fraudulent method to appear as an individual, real-life person, (iii) is not using pre-populated fields, and (iv) completes all of the information required for such action within the given <u>time period allowed</u> by SELLAPLEASURE and (v) is not later determined by SELLAPLEASURE to
    be fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate.
    <br><br>
    3. As long as your account balance is currently larger than $100, we'll pay you any
    Commissions you've earned on a monthly basis. Where the balance of the account is less
    than $100 this will trigger a 'roll over' to the next month, and it will do so every month until
    $100 in commissions is reached. Any previously paid Qualified Actions that are later found
    to not have complied with the qualifications to be a Qualified Action may be charged back
    to your account.
    <br><br>
    4. You agree that INNOV8 shall only be liable to you for Commissions to the extent that
    SELLAPLEASURE has received such monies from the Clients since payment for
    Commissions is contingent upon Clients paying over such funds to INNOV8. You hereby
    waive any claims for commissions that INNOV8 may have.
    <br><br>
    5. INNOV8 will automatically create an invoice for Affiliate on behalf of any Commissions
    due under this Agreement and will pay Affiliate in accordance with such invoice. INNOV8
    will track all Links and make all decisions about Qualified Actions and Commissions at its
    exclusive discretion. Affiliate shall provide INNOV8 with written notice of any good faith
    dispute with respect to any portion of an invoice within thirty (30) days of the date of the
    invoice. Affiliate agrees that it will forever waive any claims based on the invoice if it does
    not contest it as stated in this agreement. Affiliate must submit reports to INNOV8 within
    three (3) days of the 30th day of the month if Affiliate is also tracking Qualified Actions
    and there is a discrepancy. If SELLAPLEASURE reasonably determines that Affiliate has
    used generally recognized industry methods to track Qualified Actions, then INNOV8 and
    Affiliate agree to make a good faith effort to resolve the discrepancy. If the parties are
    unable to come to an agreement, INNOV8's numbers will take precedence.
    <br><br>
    Affiliate agrees that SELLAPLEASURE may deduct any such amounts due to SELLAPLEASURE from
    amounts due to Affiliate under this Agreement if Affiliate has an outstanding balance due to
    SELLAPLEASURE under this Agreement or any other agreement between the Affiliate and
    SELLAPLEASURE, whether or not related to the Affiliate Program. Affiliation also accepts the following:
    <br><br>
    1. Be solely responsible for the creation, operation, and upkeep of your Media, as well as for
    all content posted on or linked from it.
    <br><br>
    2. Make sure that none of the content shared on your media or otherwise used in connection
    with the affiliate program: (i) is not unlawful, (ii) does not infringe upon the intellectual
    property or personal rights of any third party and is free from(iii) harassment, (iv) harmful
    materials and is not (v) threatening, (v) defamatory, (v) obscene, does not v) promote
    violence, (v) promote discrimination (whether based on sex, religion, race, ethnicity
    (collectively, "Objectionable").
    <br><br>
    3. Unless expressly permitted in this agreement, refrain from making any representations,
    warranties, or other assertions about Client, INNOV8, or any of their individual products or
    services.
    <br><br>
    4. Without our prior written consent, make sure that your Media does not mimic or replicate
    the appearance and feel of the Program Web Site or give the idea that it has been approved
    by INNOV8 or Clients or that it is a component of the Program Web Site.
    <br><br>
    5. Only use the coupons and deals that have been communicated to them for affiliate traffic.
    Do not post discount codes that have already been shared elsewhere.
    <br><br>
    6. Never place a bid on an INNOV8 trade mark or a client's trademark.
    <br><br>
    7. Comply with all of your I legal obligations, this Agreement's requirements, and limits, as
    well as (ii) any laws, rules, and ordinances that apply to your business, your Media, or your
    use of the Links.

    by the Affiliate in connection with the Affiliate Program, including but not limited to email
    providers, social networking sites, and ad networks.

    identifiable information to third parties.

    post and make available to end-users any terms and restrictions in connection with the
    Offer stipulated by INNOV8 or Client.

    Network according to the highest industry standards. Affiliate shall not permit any party

    to be a Third Party Affiliate whose web site or business model involves content

    confirm that all Third Party Affiliates have expressly agreed to this Agreement and have

    conditions of this Agreement or who could reasonably be expected to do so will be

    promptly remove any Third Party Affiliate from the Affiliate Program and revoke their
    access to any upcoming Offers of INNOV8 in the Network. Affiliate is still responsible for
